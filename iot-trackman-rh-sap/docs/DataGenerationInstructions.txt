Two classes have a main method that can be executed:
1. TrackmanDataGenerate - to generate schema and DDL files.
2. TrackManShotViewer - to view 2D plots of shots generated by the Trackman test server.

The TrackmanDataGenerator generates 3 files found in the "src/main/resources/generated/":
1. SqlAnywhereSchema.ddl - SQL Anywhere schema and insert statements
2. HanaSchema.ddl - HANA schema and insert statements
3. ballPositions.csv - used by TrackManShotViewer to plot the shot 

TrackmanDataGenerator takes a file of Trackman test server messages as input. The default input file is located here:
  "src/main/resources/trackman/trackman-messages.json". If you want to generate a different input file you need to connect
  to the Trackman test server.

Connect to Trackman test server and collect data:
1. In browser, open URL "http://tour.trackman.com:9500/tournament/4211d6f5-ab19-48fc-9022-66a0543128ed"
2. In browser Websocket client, open server URL "ws://tour.trackman.com:9501/ws"
3. In Websocket client, enter request "{"Type": "Subscribe",    "Payload": {"Topics": ["Broadcast"]}}"
4. You should receive a message saying that you are subscribed.
5. Back in browser test server page, hit some shots. *** Do not hit another shot until the 
   last message (Broadcast/Measurement/Measurement) is received in the Websocket client. ***
6. After last shot, copy the Websocket client's message log into a file located in "src/main/resources/trackman/".
7. If you created a new file, change TrackmanDataGenerator.INPUT_FILE to point to that file.
8. Run TrackmanDataGenerator to generate new files using the new input file.
